About Me
======
I am a first-year PhD student at [COSIC](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/), KU Leuven. I am interested in zk-SNARKs and, in particular, making them secure and efficient for practical applications. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Fr√©derik Vercauteren](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/people/person/?u=u0031924). 

Previously, I did my Master's thesis at COSIC on distributed FRI-based SNARKs (Promotor: [Prof. Nigel Smart](https://nigelsmart.github.io/)), where I was lucky to have three wonderful mentors: [Jiayi Kang](https://jiayikang2.github.io/), [Mariana Gama](https://mmargama.github.io/) and [Emad Heydari Beni](https://heydari.be/).
